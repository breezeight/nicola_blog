= Yoga intro

== Asana

“The third limb of yoga is asana or posture. Asana brings steadiness, health and lightness of limb. A steady and pleasent posture produces mental equilibrium and prevents fickleness of mind. Asanas are not merely gymnastic exercises; they are postures … By practicing them one develops agility, balance, endurance and great vitality.

Asanas have evolved over the centuries so as to exercise every muscle, nerve and gland in the body. They secure a fine physique, which is strong and elastic without being muscle bound and they keep the body free from disease. They reduce fatigue and soothe the nerves. But their real importance lies in the way they train and discipline the mind… The yogi frees himself from physical disabilities and mental distractions by practicing Asana…. The yogi conquers the body by the practice of asanas and makes it a fit vehicle for the spirit.”

(B.K.S Iyengar, Light On Yoga, 1965, pg 42)

== Reciprocal Inhibition

http://www.bandhayoga.com/keys_recip.html

there are a number of physiological feedback loops that balance the flow of energy in the body. One of these is the primitive spinal cord reflex known as reciprocal inhibition.  This reflex causes the antagonist muscle to relax when the synergist contracts.

== Hamstring

ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring

A hamstring is one of the three posterior thigh muscles in between the hip and the knee (from medial to lateral: semimembranosus, semitendinosus and biceps femoris).
They

They are unique in the body because they *cross two joints*, the hip and the knee. Muscles that cross more than one joint have the privilege of improved leverage and can be very powerful.

NOTE: all major joints of the body - the shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, and ankles - are governed by at least one TJM

image::images/yoga_hamstring.jpg[]

== Quadriceps

Muscles that are in the front of your thigh.

== Calf Muscles

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calf_(leg)

The calf (Latin: sura) is the back portion of the lower leg in human anatomy. The muscles within the calf correspond to the posterior compartment of the leg. The two largest muscles within this compartment are known together as the calf muscle and attach to the heel via the Achilles tendon. Several other, smaller muscles attach to the knee, the ankle, and via long tendons to the toes.

== Two Joint Muscles

https://breakingmuscle.com/fitness/two-jointed-muscles-of-the-lower-body-what-they-are-and-how-to-train

Here are three *lower-body two-jointed muscles*, the joints they function at, and their actions:

* Muscle: Semitendinosus, semimembranosus, and biceps femoris (long head)
** Joints: Hip and knee
**  Action: Hip extension and knee flexion


* Muscle: Rectus femoris (one of the quadriceps)
** Joints: Hip and knee
** Action: Hip flexion and knee extension


* Muscle: Gastrocnemius (calf)
** Joints: Knee and ankle
** Action: Knee flexion and ankle plantar flexion

== Groins

https://www.yogajournal.com/practice/locating-the-groin-muscles



*Medically*, the groin is the junction between the abdomen and thigh. When you lift your thigh toward your chest, a crease forms at this junction. Technically, the groin runs along the entire length of the crease, and it's still the groin after the thigh descends and the crease goes away.

When a teacher talks about moving the groin, they often mean to move the very uppermost part of the thigh immediately below the groin. The plural "groins" simply refers to the groin of the left leg and that of the right leg, taken together.

However, when some teachers say "groin," they are referring only to the part of the groin nearest the inner thigh. Other teachers call this area the "inner groin" and its counterpart near the outer end of the hip crease the "outer groin." In this case, they sometime use the plural "groins" to refer to the inner and outer parts of the groin of the same leg, as in, "lift the inner and outer groins equally."

 *B.K.S. Iyengar* definition
 * of *groin* : the whole junction of the thigh and pelvis, around the entire circumference of the thigh.
 * *back groin* the crease below the buttock where it joins the back of the thigh.
 * *inner back groin* and the *outer back groin*. It's enough to make you groan!

But, in fact, when you understand what the teacher is saying, and you learn to make the various parts of the groin move as directed, it can really enhance your asana practice. As you can see, different teachers use the word "groins" differently. It's good teaching practice to define a confusing word like this to the class before using it, so you might consider asking your yoga teacher to do so for your class next time the term is used.

== Invocation to Sage Patanjali by Iyengar (Ashish class)

Text: http://bksiyengar.com/modules/IYoga/sage.htm
Audio: http://bksiyengar.com/audio/invocation.mp3

|=======
| Sanskrit																	| English
|	Yogena cittasya padena vacam malam				| Let us bow before the noblest of sages Patanjali, who gave yoga for
| sarirasya ca vaidyakena yopakarottam			| serenity and sanctity of mind, grammar for clarity and purity of
| pravaram muninam patanjalim						  	| speech and medicine for perfection of health. Let us prostrate before
| pranajaliranato'smi abahu purusakaram		  | Patanjali, an incarnation of Adisesa, whose upper body has a human
| sankha cakrasi dharinamsahasra sirasam    | form, whose arms hold a conch and a disc, and who is crowned by a
| svetam pranamami patanjalim.							| thousand-headed cobra.
|=======

Sage Patanjali has penned the ancient Indian heritage of Yoga through his treatise the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, which is an encompassing study of the subject which consists of just 196 sutras (aphorisms).
In the present century, Yogacharya B.K.S. Iyengar has made it possible for ordinary human beings to experience the wisdom of these sutras in the midst of living a life.

Adho = downward

== Salamba

Salamba is a Sanskrit word meaning “to support.” Its opposite is niralamba, which means “unsupported” or “without support.”

Salamba describes a pose in which the yogi uses the hands, arms or other type of support for balance or to otherwise aid in exercise of the posture.

NOTE: Salamba yoga poses should be mastered before the yogi attempts the more challenging niralamba versions. Some common salamba poses include:

* Salamba kapotasana (supported pigeon) - a half split with the hands placed on the ground for support
* Salamba sarvangasana (supported shoulder stand) - the upper arms rest on the ground and the hands rest on the lower back
* Salamba bhujangasana (supported cobra, or sphinx) - the forearms provide support for the backbend
* Salamba sirsasana (supported headstand) - the forearms and interlocked hands form a sort of basket to support the head and provide balance
* Salamba balasana (supported child's pose) - the torso and head rest on a prop, typically a rolled-up blanket or several blankets

TODO Mettere il link al video di yehuda 

* Virasana (3 min):
  * 1 Kneel on the floor (use a folded blanket or bolster to wedge between your calves and thighs if necessary), with your thighs perpendicular to the floor, and touch your inner knees together. Slide your feet apart, slightly wider than your hips, with the tops of the feet flat on the floor. Angle your big toes slightly in toward each other and press the top of each foot evenly on the floor.  See that you are sitting on both the buttock evenly.
  * 2 Exhale and sit back halfway, with your torso leaning slightly forward. Wedge your thumbs into the backs of your knees and draw the skin and flesh of the calf muscles toward the heels. Then sit down between your feet.
  * 3 If your buttocks don’t comfortably rest on the floor, raise them on a block or thick book placed between the feet. Make sure both sitting bones are evenly supported. Allow a thumb’s-width space between the inner heels and the outer hips. Turn your thighs inward and press the heads of the thigh bones into the floor with the bases of your palms. Then lay your hands in your lap, one on the other, palms up, or on your thighs, palms down.
  * 4 Firm your shoulder blades against the back ribs and lift the top of your sternum like a proud warrior. Widen the collarbones and release the shoulder blades away from the ears. Lengthen the tailbone into the floor to anchor the back torso.
  * 5 At first stay in this pose from 30 seconds to 1 minute. Gradually extend your stay up to 5 minutes. To come out, press your hands against the floor and lift your buttocks up, slightly higher than the heels. Cross your ankles underneath your buttocks, sit back over the feet and onto the floor, then stretch your legs out in front of you. It may feel good to bounce your knees up and down a few times on the floor.

Viraba


=== 2020-12-08

In meditation, it's not important just to sit. Meditation is not separate from life, from living, we have to be very humble, without direction, without motive, humble, not wanting, not seeking, not demanding. To be very humble, with no motive. Be so humble, without the past, so you can see something new. If we are seeking, demanding, it means that we already know what we are going to find and there is a motive to find that. 
The beginning of meditation is to make order, which means not wanting, not seeking, not demanding, trying to fulfill, trying to escape. Be so humble, so empty, so that we can discover something that is new. You discover something that is new if you don't have the motive to discover something new. Motive is effort... can we live in this world without motive, without effort, so that we can live free, simple, honest.

* 1 Strap on the outer part of your calf muscles
* 1 block in between your thighs, long side perpendicular to the floor, medium side touch on the thights and completely touch on the perineum.
* stretch your toes forward, pressurise your heels.
* Pull the block with your inner upper thighs, turn the front thighs. So you can touch the in the front inner thighs on the block. Don't pull the block from the back of your thigh.
* Separate your back legs
* work on the back of your legs
* stretch your knees, don't bend them
* Don't push your abdomen forward but toward your (it happens when you pull the block from the back of your thigh.)
* Q: è quindi vero che devo controllare l'addome dalle thigh????
* frontal pelvis go back but not up.
* from the front you need to roll in
* you need to spread and lift the pubes (Mi sembra un po' in contrasto con quello che dice Sara... )

=== Intro

In our bipedal form, the hips and lower extremities are the weight-bearing construct. The more mobile shoulders and upper extremities allow us to interact with the world.

In arm balances:

* we invert this construct, thereby strengthening the muscles, bones, and ligaments of the upper extremities.
* From an energetic perspective, arm balances stimulate the nerve plexuses associated with the fourth and fifth chakras.

From an energetic perspective:

* arm balances stimulate the nerve plexuses associated with the fourth and fifth chakras.
* Practicing these poses with precision moves nerve impulses upwards through the subtle body.
