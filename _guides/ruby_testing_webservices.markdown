#Â AWS SDK Example

This paragraph is based on:
* `git@github.com:aws/aws-sdk-core-ruby.git`
* tag: `v2.0.14`




Uses JSON-SCHEMA https://github.com/ruby-json-schema/json-schema/tree/master

This repo has strange structure, it contains 3 gems.

The AWS SDK for Ruby is unit tested using RSpec.

To run unit test:

~~~ruby
    bundle install
    bundle exec rake test
~~~

To run integration tests:

* create a `integration-test-config.json` file at the root of this repository.
* It should contain a `"region"` and credentials.
* Running rake test when this file is present will enable integration tests.

The main `Rakefile` will load Rakefile contained into the subdirs:

~~~ruby
$REPO_ROOT = File.dirname(__FILE__)

$VERSION = ENV['VERSION'] || File.read(File.join($REPO_ROOT, 'VERSION')).strip

$GEM_NAMES = [
  'aws-sdk-core',
  'aws-sdk-resources',
  'aws-sdk',
]

$GEM_NAMES.each do |gem_name|
  $LOAD_PATH.unshift(File.join($REPO_ROOT, gem_name, 'lib'))
end

require 'aws-sdk'              ### Why we need to require this ??

task 'test:coverage:clear' do
  sh("rm -rf #{File.join($REPO_ROOT, 'coverage')}")
end

desc 'Runs unit tests'
task 'test:unit' => 'test:coverage:clear'

desc 'Runs integration tests'
task 'test:integration' => 'test:coverage:clear'

desc 'Runs unit and integration tests'
task 'test' => ['test:unit', 'test:integration']

task :default => :test

Dir.glob('**/*.rake').each do |task_file|
  load task_file
end

begin
  require 'coveralls/rake/task'
  Coveralls::RakeTask.new
rescue LoadError
end
~~~



aws-sdk-core/tasks/test.rake :

~~~ruby
require 'rspec/core/rake_task'  ### This file contains the RSpec rake task class

desc "aws-sdk-core unit tests"
RSpec::Core::RakeTask.new('test:unit:aws-sdk-core') do |t|
  t.rspec_opts = "-I #{$REPO_ROOT}/aws-sdk-core/lib"     ### tell rspec to add this dirs to $LOAD_PATH
  t.rspec_opts << " -I #{$REPO_ROOT}/aws-sdk-core/spec"
  t.pattern = "#{$REPO_ROOT}/aws-sdk-core/spec"          ### Load file matching pattern for rspec tests (default: "spec/**/*_spec.rb").
end
task 'test:unit' => 'test:unit:aws-sdk-core'

begin
  require 'cucumber/rake/task'
  desc = 'aws-sdk-core integration tests'
  Cucumber::Rake::Task.new('test:integration:aws-sdk-core', desc) do |t|
    t.cucumber_opts = 'aws-sdk-core/features -t ~@veryslow'  ### tell to cucumber where to find the integration tests
  end
  task 'test:integration' => 'test:integration:aws-sdk-core'
rescue LoadError
  desc 'aws-sdk-core integration tests'
  task 'test:integration' do
    puts 'skipping aws-sdk-core integration tests, cucumber not loaded'
  end
end
~~~

aws-sdk-resources/tasks/test.rake :
task 'test:unit' => 'test:unit:aws-sdk-resources'


## Integration tests
The integration test are performed using cucumber. They will be runned
only if the `integration-test-config.json` file is available or an ENV
variable is set, see here:

* aws-sdk-core/features/env.rb:cfg = './integration-test-config.json'
* aws-sdk-resources/features/env.rb:cfg = './integration-test-config.json'

Does these test hit the real server ? Yed, that's why you need also to
setup a credential file.

What is tested? Not too much, basically only idempotent query like:

* list all resources
* get a non existing resource to trigger and manage errors
* .....


## How they use webmock

They don't use webmock for everything:
