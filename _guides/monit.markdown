# Intro

What monit can do:

* start/stop process
* send alert (email)
* monitor CPU/RAM
* monitor network connections
* run periodic script for check


# Cheatsheet

* `monit status` displays monitâ€™s details
* By default, it is set up to check that services are running every 2 minutes and stores its log file in `/var/log/monit.log`
  * These settings can be altered at the beginning of the configuration file in the `set daemon` and set `logfile` lines respectively.
