### local VS global

* `Global variables or environment variables`: are available in all shells.
* `Local variables`: are only available in the current shell. 

* Variables are case sensitive
* Convention: local variables are lowercase

Each and every shell has its own environment.

**There's no Universal environment that will magically appear in all console windows.**

An environment variable created in one shell cannot be accessed in another shell.
It's even more restrictive. If one shell spawns a subshell, that subshell has access to the parent's environment variables, but if that subshell creates an environment variable, it's not accessible in the parent shell.

If all of your shells need access to the same set of variables, you can create a startup file that will set them for you. This is done in BASH via the $HOME/.bash_profile and $HOME/.bashrc files and through $HOME/.profile if $HOME/.bash_profile doesn't exist).

`export` governs which variables will be available to subshells

```
FOO=1
export BAR=2
./runScript.sh
```

then $BAR will be available in the environment of runScript.sh, but $FOO will not.


Let say we have this script that print the `name` variable:

```
# print_name.sh
echo My name is $name
```

And we run it:

```
name="nicola"
echo "My name is $name" # prints "My name is nicola"
./print_name.sh         # prints "My name is " beacuse name is local
export name="nicola"
./print_name.sh         # prints "My name is " beacuse now name is global

```


### Creating variables

`VARNAME="value"`

* spaces around the equal sign will cause error
* good habit to quote content strings when assigning values to variables
* Only ASCII letters (of either case), _ and digits are supported, 
* The first character must not be a digit (ex: 1myname is not allowed).

### Variables in a function

* By default all variables are global.
* Setting or modifying a variable in a function changes it in the whole script.
* You can create a local variables using the `local` command
  * makes the variable name have a visible scope restricted to that function and its children only.
  * syntax is:

```
function name(){
   local var=$1
}
```


Ex of set without local: bash_examples/function_local_vars.sh

```
#!/bin/bash

define_not_local_var ()
{
  not_local_variable="bar"
}

define_not_local_var

echo "not_local_variable is global: $not_local_variable"

# print:
# not_local_variable is global: bar

```

Ex of modify without local: bash_examples/function_local_vars_2.sh

```
#!/bin/bash

not_local_variable="foo"

echo "not_local_variable is global: $not_local_variable"

define_not_local_var ()
{
  not_local_variable="bar"
}

define_not_local_var

echo "not_local_variable is modified by the function: $not_local_variable"

# print:
# not_local_variable is global: foo
# not_local_variable is modified by the function: bar
```

Ex of modify with local: bash_examples/function_local_vars_3.sh


```
#!/bin/bash

my_var="foo"

echo "my_var is global: $my_var"

define_local_var ()
{
  local my_var="bar"
}

define_local_var

echo "my_var is NOT modified by the function: $my_var"
```


### Typing variables: declare or typeset

Ref: http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/declareref.html

The declare or typeset builtins, which are exact synonyms, permit modifying the properties of variables. This is a very weak form of the typing

* readonly variables: `declare -r`

```
declare -r var1=1
echo $var1   # print: 1
var1 = 2     # print: bash: declare: var1: readonly variable
echo $var1   # stil print: 1
```

* integer variables: `declare -i`

```
declare -i number
# The script will treat subsequent occurrences of "number" as an integer.		

number=3
echo "Number = $number"     # Number = 3

number=three
echo "Number = $number"     # Number = 0
# Tries to evaluate the string "three" as an integer.
```


### env command

* `env`
  * run a program in a modified environment

```
env name=value name2=value2 program and args
```

Runs the command program and args with an environment formed by extending the current environment with the environment variables and values designated by name=value and name2=value2. If you do not include any arguments like name=value, then the current environment is passed along unmodified.

NOTE env VS printenv: 

* env is POSIX 7, printenv is not (GNU Coreutils in Ubuntu 15.10)
* printenv can only print variables
* TIP: use always env

### Reserved Variables and positional params

* `$@`	Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one. When the expansion occurs within double quotes, each parameter expands to a separate word.
* `$*`	(similar to $@ but less used) Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one. When the expansion occurs within double quotes, it expands to a single word with the value of each parameter separated by the first character of the IFS special variable.
* `$#`	Expands to the number of positional parameters in decimal.
* `$?`	Expands to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline.
* `$-`	A hyphen expands to the current option flags as specified upon invocation, by the set built-in command, or those set by the shell itself (such as the -i).
* `$$`	Expands to the process ID of the shell.
* `$!`	Expands to the process ID of the most recently executed background (asynchronous) command.
* `$0`	Expands to the name of the shell or shell script.
* `$_`	The underscore variable is set at shell startup and contains the absolute file name of the shell or script being executed as passed in the argument list. Subsequently, it expands to the last argument to the previous command, after expansion. It is also set to the full pathname of each command executed and placed in the environment exported to that command. When checking mail, this parameter holds the name of the mail file.

Some examples: on the other special parameters:

```
franky ~> grep dictionary /usr/share/dict/words
dictionary

franky ~> echo $_
/usr/share/dict/words

franky ~> echo $$
10662

franky ~> mozilla &
[1] 11064

franky ~> echo $!
11064

franky ~> echo $0
bash

franky ~> echo $?
0  #Â Ok

franky ~> ls doesnotexist
ls: doesnotexist: No such file or directory

franky ~> echo $?
1  # Error
```


The positional parameters are the words following the name of a shell script: `$1`, `$2`, etc

```
#!/bin/bash

# positional.sh
# This script reads 3 positional parameters and prints them out.

POSPAR1="$1"
POSPAR2="$2"
POSPAR3="$3"

echo "$1 is the first positional parameter, \$1."
echo "$2 is the second positional parameter, \$2."
echo "$3 is the third positional parameter, \$3."
echo
echo "The total number of positional parameters is $#."
eche
echo "The list of params is: $@"
```

Upon execution one could give any numbers any arguments:

```
franky ~> positional.sh one two three four five
one is the first positional parameter, $1.
two is the second positional parameter, $2.
three is the third positional parameter, $3.

The total number of positional parameters is 5.
The list of params is: one two three four five
```

```
franky ~> positional.sh one two
one is the first positional parameter, $1.
two is the second positional parameter, $2.
 is the third positional parameter, $3.

The total number of positional parameters is 2.
The list of params is: one two
```

Other variables:

# Functions

Ref: http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_11_01.html

* Shell functions are a way to group commands for later execution, using a single name for this group, or routine.
* A function is executed within the shell in which it has been declared: no new process is created to interpret the commands.
* exit status is the exit status of the last command executed in the body.
* The body of a function should end in a semicolon or a newline.
* The curly braces must be separated from the body by spaces, otherwise they are interpreted in the wrong way.

Syntax:

```
function function_name { 
  command...
} 
```

or (with this syntax parenthesis are needed):

```
function_name () { 
  command... 
} 
```

A function may be "compacted" into a single line :

* `fun () { echo "This is a function"; echo; }` # OK
* `fun () { echo "This is a function"; echo }`  # Error!
*  semicolon must follow the final command in the function.

Functions are called, triggered, simply by invoking their names. A function call is equivalent to a command.

Parameters:



Functions and variable scope:

```
define_local (){
  local local_variable="foo"
}

define_not_local ()
{
  not_local_variable="bar"
}

define_local
define_not_local

echo "local_variable is empty: $local_variable"
echo "not_local_variable: $not_local_variable"
```

# Write and debugging shell scripts

If you don't want to start a new shell but execute the script in the current shell, you source it: source script_name.sh

`#!`:Â The first line of the script determines the shell to start. The first two characters of the first line should be #!, then follows the path to the shell that should interpret the commands that follow. EX: `#!/bin/bash`

Debug with `bash -x`: (or add in your script set -x)Â The most common is to start up the subshell with the -x option, which will run the entire script in debug mode. Traces of each command plus its arguments are printed to standard output after the commands have been expanded but before they are executed.

## Examples: one line script

while true; echo "AA"; sleep 2; done

# Conditional: if then else

* Basic intro: http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO-6.html
* string and file operators `help test`

~~~bash
if [ "foo" = "foo" ]; then
   echo expression evaluated as true
else
   echo expression evaluated as false
fi
~~~

# Alias

* Aliases allow a string to be substituted for a word when it is used as the first word of a simple command.
* Aliases are expanded when a function definition is read, not when the function is executed,

# Directory Stack

* `pushd`
* `popd`
* `dirs`

# Execution Programs

When the program being executed is a shell script bash will use Fork-and-exec mechanism:

* This child process has the same environment as its parent, only the process ID number is different. This procedure is called forking.
* The address space of the child process is overwritten with the new process data. This is done through an exec call to the system.
* reads the lines from the shell script one line at a time: Commands on each line are read, interpreted and executed as if they would have come directly from the keyboard.
* the parent shell waits for its child process to finish.

NOTE: built-in commands are executed without creating a new process.



# Bash built in commands

Built-in commands are necessary to implement functionality impossible or inconvenient to obtain with separate utilities.

Bash supports 3 types of built-in commands:

Bourne Shell built-ins: `:, ., break, cd, continue, eval, exec, exit, export, getopts, hash, pwd, readonly, return, set, shift, test, [, times, trap, umask and unset`.

Bash built-in commands: `alias, bind, builtin, command, declare, echo, enable, help, let, local, logout, printf, read, shopt, type, typeset, ulimit and unalias`

Special built-in commands, When Bash is executing in POSIX mode, the special built-ins differ from other built-in commands in three respects:

1. Special built-ins are found before shell functions during command lookup.
2. If a special built-in returns an error status, a non-interactive shell exits.
3. Assignment statements preceding the command stay in effect in the shell environment after the command completes.

The POSIX special built-ins are :`, ., break, continue, eval, exec, exit, export, readonly, return, set, shift, trap and unset`.


## exec

### Use exec to redirect outputs from within a script

REF: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8888251/understanding-bash-exec-12-command

Example:

~~~bash
function example()
{
    exec 1>&2  # from this point one stdout will be directed to stderr
    cat <<EOT
Script requires at least one parameter.
EOT
    exit 1
} 
~~~

## set

Ref:

* `man set`  https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#index-set
* http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/255581/what-does-set-command-without-arguments-do

`set` allows you:

* to change the values of shell options
* set the positional parameters
* to display the names and values of shell variables (Without arguments, set will print all shell variables (both environment variables and variables in current session) sorted in current locale).

* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/78497/design-patterns-or-best-practices-for-shell-scripts

## GETOPTS

* `help getopts`
* `getopts` tutorial: http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/howto/getopts_tutorial

Getopts is used by shell procedures to parse positional parameters as options.

Syntax: `getopts: getopts optstring name [arg]`

* OPTSTRING contains the option letters to be recognized; if a letter is followed by a colon, the option is expected to have an argument, which should be separated from it by white space.
* Each time it is invoked, getopts will place the next option in the shell variable $name, initializing name if it does not exist, and the index of the next argument to be processed into the shell variable OPTIND.
* When an option requires an argument, getopts places that argument into the shell variable OPTARG.

BEST PRACTICE: The common way is that the processing of all arguments precedes the actual job of the program/script.
