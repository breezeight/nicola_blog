# Add class method including a module

Using only `include MyModule`, this pattern will allow you to add methods both to:

* the Student class singleton_class
* the objects instance of the Student class

To obtain this result you need aÂ module `ClassMethods` nested into the `MyModule`. MyModule will use the `included` hook of `MyModule` to extend the including class.

**TODO**: check if this pattern is deprecated by `refinements`

~~~ruby
module MyModule
  def self.included(klass)
    klass.extend ClassMethods
  end

  module ClassMethods
    def has_many(*args)
      # ...
    end
  end
end

class Student
  include MyModule

  has_many :books
end
~~~
