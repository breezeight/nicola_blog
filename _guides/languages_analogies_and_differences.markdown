# Scope and Binding

Ref:

* [Scope definition on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_%28computer_science%29)
* [Name Binding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_binding)

`name binding` is the association of entities (data and/or code) with identifiers.
An identifier bound to an object is said to reference that object.
Machine languages have no built-in notion of identifiers, but
name-object bindings as a service and notation for the programmer is
implemented by programming languages.


The `scope` of a name binding is the part of a computer program where
the binding is valid: where the name can be used to refer to the entity.

The term `scope` is also used to refer to the set of all entities that
are visible or names that are valid within a portion of the program or
at a given point in a program, which is more correctly referred to as
context or environment.
