# Install Docker
On recent linux Docker is really easy to install but on OS like
windows and OSX it's a little bit harder and you need to use ONE classical virtual machine to run Linux and Docker.

## boot2docker

### OSX


You can upgrade your existing Boot2Docker VM without data loss by running: `boot2docker upgrade`
This will delete your persistent data, but will also ensure that you have the latest VirtualBox configuration.


### Mount Volumes issues on OSX

Boot2docker 1.3 supports volumes mounting but with some limitation:

* limited to boot2dockerâ€™s virtualbox configuration
* cannot be managed dynamically, and only works for directories in **/Users**
* Expect this area to improve drastically in the next few releases.

`docker run -v /Users/bob/myapp/src:/src [...]` Will mount the directory /Users/bob/myapp/src from your Mac into the container.

$ ls /Users/nicolabrisotto/fig_django_test
django-12factor-docker
$ docker run -v /Users/nicolabrisotto/fig_django_test/:/pippo ubuntu:trusty  ls pippo
django-12factor-docker


There are still some limitations:






Problem: The current version of docker (1.2) support only [data volumes](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes/) mounted from the host running the docker deamon. Boot2docker execute the docker client on OSX and the docker deamon in VirtualBox.

Problem: To mount a volume from OSX into a container you need two steps:

* Share the directory between OSX and VBox
* Share the same directory from the VBox vm and the docker container

Current solution (not upstream), to mount the /Users directory into the
boot2docker-vm:

* Install from [here](http://boot2docker.io/)
* Download the boot2docker iso with VBox addition from [here](https://medium.com/boot2docker-lightweight-linux-for-docker/boot2docker-together-with-virtualbox-guest-additions-da1e3ab2465c) and copy it to `~/.boot2docker/boot2docker.iso`
* Recreate the boot2docker-vm:  `boot2docker destroy; boot2docker init`
* Create the VBox share: `VBoxManage sharedfolder add boot2docker-vm -name home -hostpath /Users`

If you want to create a custom share and automount it at boot, create a
new script like `/etc/rc.d/vbox-guest-additions-permanent-mount`

Ref:

* [VBox shared folders](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#sharedfolders)
`sharedfolder  add <uuid|vmname> --name <name> --hostpath <hostpath> [--transient] [--readonly] [--automount]`

A temporary solution will be pushed upstream with boot2docker 1.3:

* see [here](https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/pull/534) the
discussion
* [boot2docker 1.3 doc about vbox shares](https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker#virtualbox-guest-additions)

Docker is working on a new proposal that could solve the issue allowing
docker to mount [remote shared volumes](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/7249)

### FIG issues
Fig relies heavly on volumes and variables. I need to understand how to
manage these issues on OSX.

With the current boot2docker 1.2 we need to map dirs in our home (ex:
~/figtest), but what does "." means in a fig.yml file??? This solution
is a trick that maps the Vbox host /Users dir the same VM dir, this way
you obtain a mirror of the /User dir.

* how could we write a 12 factor app that works with fig and AWS
Beanstalk??? 


TODO: read the make file of this project and implements it in FIG: https://github.com/ricardokirkner/django-12factor-docker



# Docker

## Volumes

[volumes](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes/) 

There are two primary ways you can manage data in Docker.

* Data volumes
* Data volume containers

Use-cases:

* development: we can mount our source code inside the container and see our application at work as we change the source code.
* database

Feedback:

* http://github.com/opscode/knife-container

FAQ:

* Docker container scope do not include volumes mounting. For this task
you can use chef-metal or docker.
* At the moment (oct 2014) chef-server see a container as an host, there is no
support for clean-up. May be chef-metal can manage something for you.
