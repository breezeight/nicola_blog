https://www.healthline.com/health/benefits-of-vajrasana#how-to-do-it


For this pose, you kneel and then sit back on your legs to take the weight off your knees. Breathing and meditative exercises are often done in this position, which is said to help your body become as strong as a diamond.


How to make the Vajrasana pose more comfortable: if you find the Vajrasana pose uncomfortable, ask your yoga instructor to make sure that youâ€™re doing it correctly. Some techniques you can use to ease discomfort include:

* For ankle pain, consider putting a folded blanket or other uniform padding under your shins. Position the blanket so your toes hang off the back.
* For knee pain, consider placing a rolled or folded blanket or towel across your calves and tucking it behind your knees.
* For sitting discomfort, place a yoga block between your feet horizontally. By supporting some of your weight, this can take pressure off ankles and knees.
