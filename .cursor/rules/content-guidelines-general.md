# General Project Rules

## Repository Purpose
This is a personal knowledge base containing markdown notes on various technical topics, organized for easy reference and learning.

## Code Style
- Use consistent formatting for markdown files
- Wrap regex patterns in backticks to prevent MkDocs warnings
- Use proper markdown syntax for links and code blocks
- Use proper header hierarchy (H1, H2, H3, etc.)
- Include code blocks with appropriate syntax highlighting
- Use tables for structured information
- Add images and diagrams where helpful
- Include anchor links for easy navigation

## File Organization

### Directory Structure
- **docs/dev/** - Development and technical topics
- **docs/yoga_poses/** - Yoga-related content
- **docs/images/** - Supporting images and diagrams
- **docs/downloads/** - Downloadable resources
- Keep documentation files in `docs/` directory

### Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive, lowercase filenames with hyphens or underscores (e.g., `python-learning.md`)
- Group related topics in subdirectories (e.g., `aws/`, `python-language-reference-nicola/`)
- Use consistent naming patterns within topic areas
- Organize content by topic in subdirectories

## Content Guidelines

### File Structure
1. **Title/Header** - Clear, descriptive title
2. **Introduction** - Brief overview of the topic
3. **Main Content** - Organized with proper headers
4. **Examples** - Code snippets, configurations, or practical examples
5. **References** - Links to external resources, documentation

- Group related information together
- Include table of contents for long documents
- Use lists and tables for structured information
- Organize content logically with clear sections

#### Accuracy and Maintenance
- Keep information current and accurate

- Update content when technologies change
- Include version numbers and dates where relevant
- Review and update links regularly
- Add troubleshooting sections where relevant

#### Accessibility
- Use descriptive link text
- Include alt text for images
- Ensure proper contrast in code examples
