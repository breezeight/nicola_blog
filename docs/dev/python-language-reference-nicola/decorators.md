Functions in Python areÂ [first class citizens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_citizen). This means that they support operations such as being passed as an argument, returned from a function, modified, and assigned to a variable. This property is crucial as it allows functions to be treated like any other object in Python, enabling greater flexibility in programming.
