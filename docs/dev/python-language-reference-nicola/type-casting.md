# Type Casting

The process of converting the value of one data type (integer, string, float, etc.) to another data type is called type conversion. 

Python has two types of type conversion:

- **Implicit**: the conversion is done automatically by the Python interpreter.
- **Explicit**: the conversion is done explicitly by the programmer using the built-in functions.

See [Python Type Conversion and Casting](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/type-conversion-and-casting) for more details:

- Implicit example: int to float
- Explicit example: str to ints
