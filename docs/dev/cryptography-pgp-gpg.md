# PGP - GPG

## Introduction

[GnuGP](https://gnupg.org/) helps protect our privacy by allowing us to encrypt and sign data and information.

[OpenPGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) is highly significant for the free software community, including both developers and users. Members of the community utilize OpenPGP technology to cryptographically sign their software packages, announcements, and security notices. The strength and protection that OpenPGP offers to the community are directly tied to the robustness of the web of trust.

**Pretty Good Privacy** (**PGP**) is an [encryption program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption_software) that provides [cryptographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic) [privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy) and [authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication) for [data communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_communication). PGP is used for:

* [Signing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature): authenticating documents with digital signatures.  
* Encrypting and decrypting texts, [emails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email), files, directories, and even entire disk partitions.  
* Increasing the [security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security) of email communications.  
* Exchanging and verifying keys.  
* Encrypting and decrypting documents.  
* Keypair creation.

PGP and similar software adhere to the OpenPGP standard (RFC 4880), an open standard for encrypting and decrypting [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data). Modern versions of PGP are [interoperable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperability) with GnuPG and other OpenPGP-compliant systems.

PGP encryption uses a combination of several foundational cryptographic concepts:

* [Hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function)  
* [Symmetric-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_cryptography)  
* [Public-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography)  
* [Data compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression)

Each step utilizes one of several supported [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm). Each public key is associated with a username or an email address, which helps establish identity within the web of trust.
