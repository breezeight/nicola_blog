## Language and Standard Library References

* [python-language-reference-nicola](https://nicolaiarocci.com/python-language-reference/): my personal reference for the python language.

* [python-official-language-reference-with-ai](python-official-language-reference-with-ai.md): this is tentative of make AI summarize the python language reference. THE PROBLEM is that the original text is meant to be read by developers of the core of language, so it **is too technical**.
