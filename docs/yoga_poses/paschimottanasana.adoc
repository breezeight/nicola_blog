Lumbar-pelvic rhythm refers to a type of joint coupling whereby tilting the pelvis in one direction produces a corresponding movement in the lumbar:

* Tilting the pelvis back (tucking the tailbone) produces flexion of the lumbar vertebrae. 
* Tilting the pelvis forward produces extension.

Pelvic-femoral rhythm refers to joint coupling at the hip whereby:

* flexing the femur produces a corresponding forward tilt of the pelvis
* and vice versa for extending the femur.
